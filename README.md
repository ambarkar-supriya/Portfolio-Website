# Portfolio-assignment

I have created 4 HTML pages:
- Home Page
- About Me page
- Contact Me page
- My Gallery Page

## Home Page
- Added a navigation bar, a photo of mine with animation, LinkedIn, GitHub, contact, and mail links for easy reach, and a footer with applied styling.

## About Me Page
- Included details such as education background, skills, projects, achievements, and hobbies with styling applied.

## Contact Me Page
- Created a form with validations; clicking the submit button opens an email client to send a custom message.

Additionally, I have implemented responsiveness for all pages using media queries.
